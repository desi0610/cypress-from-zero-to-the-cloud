# Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

Continuous integration is a technique where code from multiple developers and testers is integrated continuously into the main branch of a remote repository.

When a change is pushed to this central location, an automated routine is triggered to ensure that the new version works.

If the new version doesn't work (proved by a failed test), the workflow "breaks", and we don't run the risk of releasing broken software to our users.

Since this project code is on GitHub, we will leverage [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to create the continuous integration workflow.

## Suggested contents

Here is the official Cypress documentation as well as the GitHub Actions documentation, with everything you need to know to run your Cypress tests on GitHub Actions.

- https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/github-actions#Cypress-GitHub-Action
- https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#readme

## Exercise

1. At the root of the project, create a hidden directory called `.github/`, and within that, create a sub-directory called `workflows/`.

> 👨‍🏫 You should have the following structure `.github/workflows/`

2. Inside the `.github/workflows/` directory, create a file called `ci.yml`, with the following content:

```yml
name: End-to-end tests
on: push
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6

```

**Reference:** https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#end-to-end-testing

> 👨‍🏫 The file name can be any random name. I chose `ci` because it stands for continuous integration.

3. With `git`, add all your changes to the _staging_ area (`git add .`).
4. Make a commit with the message `Configure the ci workflow` (`git commit -m "Configure the ci workflow"`.)
5. Push your local changes to your remote fork on GitHub (`git push origin main`.)
6. Go to GitHub and see your changes firing the workflow (and if all goes well, see your tests passing.)

## Extra exercise 

1. Access the src/script.js file and break something on purpose.
2. Add all your changes (`git add .`).
3. Make a commit with the message `Break the app on purpose` (`git commit -m "Break the app on purpose"`).
4. Push your local changes to your remote fork on GitHub (`git push origin main`).
5. Go to GitHub and see your changes firing the workflow and one (or more) test(s) failing.


## Extra exercise 2

Correct the changes from the previous exercise (or revert them), run the necessary `git` commands, go to GitHub, and see your changes firing the workflow again (and if all goes well, see your tests passing again).

Congrats! Let's go to [lesson 11](./11.md) to integrate the project with Cypress Cloud.
